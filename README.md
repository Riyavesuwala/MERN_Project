# MERN Stack Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my learning journey in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
It contains practice projects, experiments, and notes created while learning full-stack web development.

The focus is on understanding core concepts, best practices, and real-world application structure, rather than building production-ready applications.
